# ProtoGraph

or Protocol Buffers definition graphical viewer,

this is not editor, this is not syntax validator, just viewer.

You may be familiar with a situation where you have a data structure definition divided into several files, and you are confused and frustrated by constantly scrolling and switching between them. Me too. So I decided to make this viewer. I hope it will be as helpful to you as it was to me.

ProtoGraph is simple Java Swing application, you need Java Runtime Environment installed in your system. You can build it with Maven, or download compiled bundle. You can run it with command:

`java -jar protograph.jar`

or you can give it files to open:

`java -jar protograph.jar file1.proto file2.proto file3.proto`
